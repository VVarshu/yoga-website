        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 150%;">In 2012, Mr. Veeresh Kumar founded the Sri Guru Raya School of Yoga with the mission of guiding people towards a healthy lifestyle by imparting the ancient science of body and mind inherited from our ancestors. Over the past decade, the school has significantly enhanced the well-being of numerous individuals, not only in Nagarbhavi but also around the world.
            Veeresh is a respected yoga teacher in Bengaluru, with over two decades of experience in practicing and teaching yoga. He holds a postgraduate degree and an MSc in Yogic Sciences and is also a trained mridangam artist. Veeresh has had the opportunity to teach both individual and group classes for private and corporate clients.
            His teaching style is based on a deep understanding of yoga philosophy as a scientific approach to self-development and self-transformation, combined with a thorough knowledge of human anatomy. This allows him to tailor practice sequences to meet his students' needs.
            The school focuses on various forms of yoga, including Raja Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, and Jnana Yoga, which aim to uplift people's lives physically, mentally, socially, psychologically, and spiritually. It has started conducting therapeutic yoga sessions with systematic procedures and individual counseling, and has introduced a variety of meditation sessions such as cyclic meditation and singing bowl meditation.
            Veeresh believes that a positive attitude is essential for overcoming limitations and resistance. He conducts many sessions on the Bhagavad-Gita, Vedas, and Upanishads, and also performs homas, poojas, and women empowerment sessions on a weekly basis. To test his students' physical abilities and motivate them to believe in their strength, he organizes trekking activities.
            His students are growing into individuals with great confidence and emotional stability. The Sri Guru Raya Wellness Center is consistently working for the betterment of its students and has received many successful testimonials."
